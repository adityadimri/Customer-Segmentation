# Customer-Segmentation
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics, so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.
A customer segmentation model allows for the effective allocation of marketing resources and the maximization of cross and up-selling opportunities.
# Data Driven Approach
We will be using RFM model for customer segmentation
RFM segmentation  refers to dividing customers into groups on three criteria (which compose the RFM Acronym):
	Recency. How much time since a customer’s last activity or transaction with the company?
	Frequency. How often has a customer transacted with the company during a particular period of time?
	Monetary. How much a customer has spent with the brand during a particular period of time.
